# Third-party middleware

Third-party middleware means not in the core of Hono.
Built-in middleware does not depend on other libraries, but these can use external libraries.

Third-party middleware will be managed under honojs organization on GitHub and published in @honojs namespace. For example, there is middleware named `hello`, its repository will be `github.com/honojs/hello` and published `@honojs/hello`.

There are third-party middleware below, now.
The use of third-party middleware is no different from the use of other middleware.
