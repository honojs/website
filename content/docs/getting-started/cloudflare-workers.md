# Cloudflare Workers

A Cloudflare Workers is a JavaScript edge runtime on Cloudflare CDN.

You can develop the application locally and publish it with a few commands using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), a CLI developed by Cloudflare.
Wrangler includes trans compiler, so we can write the code with TypeScript.

Letâ€™s make your first application for Cloudflare Workers with Hono.

## 1. Install

### `wrangler init`

Initialize the project with Wrangler.

```
mkdir hono-example
cd hono-example
npx wrangler init -y
```

### `npm install hono`

Install `hono` from the npm registry.

```
npm i hono
```

## 2. Hello World

Edit `src/index.ts`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello! Hono!'))

export default app
```

## 3. Run

Run the development server locally. Then, access `http://localhost:8787` in your Web browser.

```
npx wrangler dev
```

## 4. Publish

If you have the Cloudflare account, you can deploy to Cloudflare.

```
npx wrangler publish ./src/index.ts
```

That's all!

## Starter template

You can start making your Cloudflare Workers application with [the starter template](https://github.com/honojs/hono-minimal). It is really minimal using TypeScript, esbuild, Miniflare, and Jest.

To generate a project skeleton, run this command.

```
npx create-cloudflare my-app https://github.com/honojs/hono-minimal
```

## Advanced

### Service Worker mode or Module Worker mode

There are two syntax for writing the Cloudflare Workers. _Service Worker mode_ and _Module Worker mode_. Using Hono, you can write with both syntax:

```ts
// Service Worker
app.fire()
```

```ts
// Module Worker
export default app
```

Now, we recommend using Module Worker mode because the binding variables are localized.

### Types

You have to install `@cloudflare/workers-types` if you want to have _types_.

```
npm i --save-dev @cloudflare/workers-types
```

### Testing

For testing, we recommend using `jest-environment-miniflare`. Refer to [the starter template](https://github.com/honojs/hono-minimal) for setting it up.

If there is the application below:

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()
app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Please test me!'))
```

We can test that it is returning "_200 OK_" Response with this code:

```ts
describe('Test the application', () => {
  it('Should return 200 response', async () => {
    const res = await app.request('http://localhost/')
    expect(res.status).toBe(200)
  })
})
```

### Bindings

In the Cloudflare Workers, we can bind the environment values, KV namespace, R2 bucket, or Durable Object. You can access them in `c.env`. It will have the types if you pass the "_type struct_" for the bindings to the `Hono` as generics.

```ts
interface Env {
  BUCKET: R2Bucket
  USER: string
  PASS: string
}

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>()

// Access to environment values
app.put('/upload', async (c, next) => {
  const auth = basicAuth({ username: c.env.USER, password: c.env.PASS })
  return auth(c, next)
})
```

### Basic Auth with Variables

This is the only case for Module Worker mode.
If you want to use Variables or Secret Variables in Basic Authentication Middleware for "username" or "password", you need to write like the following. The same is applied to the tokens of the Bearer Authentication Middleware.

```ts
app.use('/auth/*', async (c, next) => {
  const auth = basicAuth({ username: c.env.USERNAME, password: c.env.PASSWORD })
  return auth(c, next)
})
```
