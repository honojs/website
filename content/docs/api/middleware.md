# Middleware

Middleware works after/before Handler. We can get `Request` before dispatching or manipulate `Response` after dispatching.

## Definition of Middleware

- Handler - should return `Response` object. Only one handler will be called.
- Middleware - should return nothing, will be proceeded to next middleware with `await next()`

The user can register middleware using `app.use` or using `app.HTTP_METHOD` as well as the handlers. For this feature, it's easy to specify the path and the method.

```ts
// match any method, all routes
app.use('*', logger())

// specify path
app.use('/posts/*', cors())

// specify method and path
app.post('/posts/*', basicAuth())
```

If the handler returns `Response`, it will be used for the end-user, and stopping the processing.

```ts
app.post('/posts', (c) => c.text('Created!', 201))
```

In this case, four middleware are processed before dispatching like this:

```ts
logger() -> cors() -> basicAuth() -> *handler*
```

## Built-in Middleware

Hono has built-in middleware.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { poweredBy } from 'hono/powered-by'
import { logger } from 'hono/logger'
import { basicAuth } from 'hono/basicAuth'

const app = new Hono()

app.use('*', poweredBy())
app.use('*', logger())

app.use(
  '/auth/*',
  basicAuth({
    username: 'hono',
    password: 'acoolproject',
  })
)
```

Available built-in middleware is listed on [the middleware section](/docs/builtin-middleware).

## Custom Middleware

You can write your own middleware.

```ts
// Custom logger
app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
  console.log(`[${c.req.method}] ${c.req.url}`)
  await next()
})

// Add a custom header
app.use('/message/*', async (c, next) => {
  await next()
  c.header('x-message', 'This is middleware!')
})

app.get('/message/hello', (c) => c.text('Hello Middleware!'))
```

## Third-party Middleware

Built-in middleware does not depend on external modules, but third-party middleware can depend on third-party libraries.
So with them, we may make more complex application.

For example, we are planning to release "*graphql-server*" middleware and "*firebase-auth*" middleware.
