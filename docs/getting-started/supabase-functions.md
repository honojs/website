# Supabase Edge Functions

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering a suite of tools similar to Firebase's capabilities, including database, authentication, storage, and now, serverless functions.

Supabase Edge Functions are server-side TypeScript functions that are distributed globally, running closer to your users for improved performance. These functions are developed using [Deno](https://deno.com/), which brings several benefits, including improved security and a modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime.

Here's how you can get started with Supabase Edge Functions:

## 1. Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the Supabase CLI installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).

### Creating a New Project

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new Supabase project in a directory on your local machine by running:

```bash
supabase init

```

This command initializes a new Supabase project in the current directory.

### Adding an Edge Function

3. Inside your Supabase project, create a new Edge Function named `hello-world`:

```bash
supabase functions new hello-world

```

This command creates a new Edge Function with the specified name in your project.

## 2. Hello World

Edit the `hello-world` function by modifying the file `supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts`:

```ts
import { Hono } from 'jsr:@hono/hono'

// change this to your function name
const functionName = 'hello-world'
const app = new Hono().basePath(`/${functionName}`)

app.get('/hello', (c) => c.text('Hello from hono-server!'))

Deno.serve(app.fetch)
```

## 3. Run

To run the function locally, use the following command:

1. Use the following command to serve the function:

```bash
supabase start # start the supabase stack
supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt # start the Functions watcher
```

The `--no-verify-jwt` flag allows you to bypass JWT verification during local development.

2. Make a GET request using cURL or Postman to `http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/hello-world/hello`:

```bash
curl  --location  'http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/hello-world/hello'
```

This request should return the text "Hello from hono-server!".

## 4. Deploy

You can deploy all of your Edge Functions in Supabase with a single command:

```bash
supabase functions deploy
```

Alternatively, you can deploy individual Edge Functions by specifying the name of the function in the deploy command:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world

```
