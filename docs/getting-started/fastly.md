# Fastly Compute

[Fastly Compute](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute) is an advanced edge computing system that runs your code, in your favorite language, on our global edge network. Hono also works on Fastly Compute.

You can develop the application locally and publish it with a few commands using [Fastly CLI](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/tools/cli/).

## 1. Setup

A starter for Fastly Compute is available.
Start your project with "create-hono" command.
Select `fastly` template for this example.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm create hono@latest my-app
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn create hono my-app
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm create hono my-app
```

```sh [bun]
bun create hono@latest my-app
```

```sh [deno]
deno init --npm hono my-app
```

:::

Move to `my-app` and install the dependencies.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
cd my-app
npm i
```

```sh [yarn]
cd my-app
yarn
```

```sh [pnpm]
cd my-app
pnpm i
```

```sh [bun]
cd my-app
bun i
```

## 2. Hello World

Edit `src/index.ts`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello Fastly!'))

app.fire()
```

## 3. Run

Run the development server locally. Then, access `http://localhost:7676` in your Web browser.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm run start
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn start
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm run start
```

```sh [bun]
bun run start
```

If you don't have an account yet, you must [create your Fastly account](https://www.fastly.com/signup/).

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm run deploy
