# Val Town

Val Town is a social website to write and deploy functions – JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX – entirely from the browser.

Val Town APIs are based on the [fetch handler standard](https://blog.val.town/blog/the-api-we-forgot-to-name), so it's extremely well suited for Hono. Hono is one of the [most-used](https://www.val.town/examples/packages/hono) packages on Val Town.

## 2. JSX

Hono JSX works with this TypeScript pragma

```ts
/** @jsxImportSource https://esm.sh/hono@3.9.2/jsx **/
```
